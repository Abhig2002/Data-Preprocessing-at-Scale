# CSE 511 Project Portfolio Report — Instructions for AI Analysis (Cursor)

## Purpose of This Document
This README provides official portfolio report instructions and constraints for the CSE 511 project portfolio.
It is intended for AI-assisted tools (e.g., Cursor) to correctly understand what the report must contain and what must be avoided.

This document does NOT describe code.
It describes report-writing requirements only.

---

## Portfolio Context
- This portfolio report is for ONE class (CSE 511: Data Processing at Scale).
- The portfolio consists of two projects combined into a single report:
  - Project 1: Graph Data Processing (Docker + Neo4j)
  - Project 2: Distributed Data Pipeline (Kafka + Kubernetes + Neo4j)
- These two projects together account for 40% of the course grade.
- This is NOT the general SCAI graduation portfolio.
- This is a class-specific portfolio report.

## Mandatory Report Requirements

### Structure (ALL must be included)
The portfolio report must include the following sections:

1. Introduction  
   - High-level overview of the combined project portfolio  
   - Motivation and goals of the work  
   - Brief description of Project 1 and Project 2 as a unified system  

2. Explanation of the Solution  
   - Conceptual explanation of how the system works  
   - High-level description of:
     - Graph data processing (Project 1)
     - Distributed streaming pipeline (Project 2)
   - Focus on architecture, data flow, and component interaction  
   - NO code-level or line-by-line explanations  

3. Description of the Results  
   - What worked when the system was executed  
   - Successful deployment, execution, and validation  
   - Confirmation that expected outputs were produced  
   - Results must be described in words, not code or logs  

4. Contributions  
   - This was an individual (solo) project  
   - Clearly state that the work was completed individually  
   - Describe personal involvement at a realistic, high level  

5. Skills, Techniques, and Knowledge Gained  
   - Conceptual understanding gained from the projects  
   - Tools, systems, and ideas learned  
   - Reflection on learning outcomes  

6. References  
   - Minimum of 4 references  
   - All references must be cited in-text  
   - Use IEEE citation format  

---

## Formatting Constraints
- Use IEEE or ACM format
- Length must be 3–4 full pages
- Figures are allowed and encouraged
- Every figure must include a caption
- Do NOT inflate margins or font sizes to meet length

---

## What MUST NOT Be Included
- Source code (Python, YAML, Dockerfile, Cypher, etc.)
- Configuration file listings
- Terminal output or logs
- Screenshots containing code or queries
- Assignment prompt text copied verbatim
- Performance benchmarks not explicitly measured

The portfolio is a summary and reflection, not a code submission.

---

## Plagiarism and Similarity Constraints
- Overall similarity must be below 40%
- Avoid copying from:
  - Project instructions
  - Course PDFs
  - Official documentation
  - Other students’ reports
- Use original phrasing and personal reflection
- Figures and diagrams are safe and encouraged

---

## Writing Style Guidance
- Prefer conceptual explanations over definitions
- Avoid generic textbook descriptions
- Avoid overstating implementation depth
- Maintain an honest, student-level academic tone
- Focus on understanding and integration, not optimization

---

## How AI Tools Should Use This
- Follow the structure listed above
- Treat Project 1 and Project 2 as a single unified portfolio
- Avoid hallucinating advanced implementation details
- Avoid producing reusable template language
- Generate original, paraphrased explanations

---

## Summary
This document defines what the portfolio report must contain,
how it should be written,
and what must be avoided.
